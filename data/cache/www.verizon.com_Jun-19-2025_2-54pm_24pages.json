Biometric Identifiers do not include writing samples, written signatures, photographs, demographic data, tattoo descriptions or physical descriptions such as height or weight. “Biometric Information” means information that is based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual.\nBiometric Identifiers and Biometric DataIn Colorado, “Biometric Identifiers” means data generated by the technological processing, measurement, or analysis of biological, physical, or behavioral characteristics, which can be processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying someone, and includes fingerprints; voiceprints; scans or records of an eye retina or iris; facial maps, facial geometry, or facial templates; or other unique biological, physical or behavioral patterns or characteristics. “Biometric Data” means one or more Biometric Identifiers that are used or intended to be used, for identification purposes.\nWhat we collect and how we use it. We may collect and use certain Biometric Data or Biometric Information (“Biometric Information”) to verify or authenticate your identity; to protect against fraud; and for safety and other security purposes. We collect Biometric Information when you consent to voice or facial authentication. When you permit us to scan your face geometry or create a voiceprint, we turn it into a stored numerical representation (the “template”). Each time you scan your face geometry or later when you speak to one of our representatives, we compare your face or your voice to the stored template associated with your account. If they match, we are able to authenticate you so that you can access account information, complete account transactions, get assistance from a Verizon representative, or visit a Verizon corporate office.\nWhen we disclose Biometric Information. We may disclose Biometric Information to service providers who work on our behalf. These service providers may use the Biometric Information disclosed to them only for purposes related to providing service to Verizon, and are required to delete the information when it is no longer needed to provide the service. We may also disclose Biometric Information to comply with law as described in the Does Verizon Disclose Information section of this Policy.\nHow long we retain Biometric Information and information security. We retain Biometric Information as follows (unless we are legally required to retain it longer):\n- We retain scans of your face geometry or voiceprint very briefly. We permanently delete the first scan after we use it to generate the stored template. Each time you authenticate, we retain your face geometry or voiceprint scan long enough to compare it to the template, then we permanently delete the scan.\n- We retain the stored template until the purpose for collecting it is satisfied. For instance, we retain stored templates of face scans for approximately 90 days from the date that you provided it. We retain voiceprints for as long as you are an active customer and are enrolled in voice authentication. Voiceprints are deleted approximately 24 hours after unenrollment or termination of service.\n- We may also retain biometric data as otherwise required to comply with applicable law or valid legal/judicial process.\n- We use technical, administrative and physical safeguards as set forth in this Privacy Policy to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of information we collect or store. We use our security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving data we process.\nWhere to exercise your rights.

      "content": "Shop Hotspots and Internet Devices\n6 results\n6 results\nA hotspot is a wireless access point that helps connect your smartphone, laptop, tablet, and other devices to the internet when WiFi isn't available. Similar to your smartphone, a hotspot device uses a cellular signal to connect to the internet. While many smartphones come with a built in hotspot, there may be some situations where your phone doesn't offer a strong enough connection for what you need to do online.\nIn those times when you need a strong, reliable connection for your devices, you can use a portable hotspot. A portable hotspot is a device that allows you to create a secure Wi-Fi network and connect all your devices to your safe, password protected private network. Additionally, we offer data plans to make sure you can stay connected even when you're on the go.\nPortable hotspots are a much more reliable way to connect to the internet, as one of the biggest risks when using public Wi-Fi is that it can be unsecured. This means that your device is vulnerable to hackers, and they have the ability to steal your personal information or install harmful software without you knowing. If keeping your data safe is a top priority, purchasing a hotspot may be in your best interest.\nIn order to use your hotspot, you will need a hotspot data plan. You can either purchase your portable hotspot device directly from Verizon, choosing from top brands like Inseego, Orbic, and TCL, or you can bring your own to our network. We currently have four different hotspot data plans available, Essential, Plus, Pro and Premium, giving you plenty of options to choose what works best for your budget and personal needs. If you're on a prepaid plan, we offer prepaid hotspots and other internet devices.\nOnce you have your hotspot and data plan, you will want to charge your portable device and activate it through the manufacturer's instructions. After completing the activation and ensuring you have a data plan, your device is ready to be used. The device name and passcode should be provided either on the device or within the instructions, and you will use that information to connect to your smartphone, laptop, or other device. And just like that, you are connected to the internet!\nHotspots are becoming more popular in the work-from-anywhere era, and you have plenty of options to choose from with Verizon. No matter which hotspot device and data plan you choose, you can know that you will be safely connected to the internet.",

You can choose any seven 24-hour periods to use per month. A router is included at no extra cost.\nHow much does Wi-Fi Backup cost?\nWi-Fi Backup is offered for as low as $20/mo when combined with a Verizon mobile plan and Auto Pay, $25/mo with Auto Pay and no mobile plan, or $30/mo without Auto Pay.

Can I take my Wi-Fi Backup service with me?\nYes, you can transfer Wi-Fi Backup to a new location if you move, if it's available in that area. You can log in to your account at Verizon.com and select Transfer Services or call us at 1-833-VERIZON, and we'll be happy to help you in transferring your service to your new address.",
