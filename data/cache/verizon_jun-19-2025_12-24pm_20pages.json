We’ve got answers.\nCan I keep my current Verizon wireless plan?\nYes, users with an existing plan can keep their current plan. However, if you're on an existing Mix & Match or Welcome Unlimited plan you can choose to switch one or all of your lines to myPlan at any time. All other plans must switch all of their lines if moving to myPlan.\nWhat are the differences between Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome?\nAll of Verizon's Unlimited plans include unlimited talk, text, and data, as well as 5G (or 4G LTE in areas where 5G isn't available), Mexico and Canada talk, text and data, as well as International texting. Unlimited plans have access to Verizon's 3-year price lock guarantee along with a phone upgrade.\nUnlimited Welcome gives you Verizon's reliable, fast 5G and the Welcome Phone Upgrade for new and existing customers.\nWith Unlimited Plus, you get our fastest 5G and access to 30 GB of Premium unlimited mobile hotspot data per month, then unlimited thereafter at 3 Mbps on 5G Ultra Wideband and 600 Kbps on 5G/4G LTE to power your other devices on the go.\nVerizon's Unlimited Ultimate offers 200 GB of premium data (unlimited thereafter at 6 Mbps) and unlimited calling and texting from 200+ countries. In addition to unlimited calling, you get enhanced video calling which has optimized video and sound quality on video calling apps in times of network congestion, when it matters most. With Unlimited Ultimate you also get 15 GB international roaming data a month, then unlimited thereafter at 1.5 mbps, and the ability to turn on 1080p HD with streaming quality of up to 4K Ultra High Definition when you’re using 5G Ultra Wideband network on a capable device.\nCheck out our latest promotions and offers.\nCan I mix and match between Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome?\nActivating more than one line?

Learn more.\nWhat are the benefits of adding a perk through Verizon?\nSave every month - check out the price savings on your favorite monthly subscriptions. Additionally, by adding perks to your plan through Verizon, you can manage those perks and subscriptions all in one place. For example, if you sign up for one of the available perk memberships, you can manage the membership through your Verizon bill and keep track of those charges all in one place.\nWill new perks be added?\nYes– keep checking back for new, updated perks. Since you aren't locked in with myPlan to any specific contract, you can add new perks or change them at any time. Just one of the many benefits of our new Unlimited plans!\nWhat is data on a cell phone plan?\nWhen you aren't connected to Wi-Fi, you connect to the internet using data. So, if you're logging onto the web but not connected to Wi-Fi, your phone will require a data plan. This includes while using apps that require an internet connection, such as social media apps and certain mobile games, etc.\nWhat is an unlimited data plan?\nSome cell phone plans limit the amount of data you can use per month (measured in gigabytes, or \"GB\"), while an unlimited data plan doesn't limit you. It's an unlimited number of GBs. Depending on which plan you select, your speeds may be slower in times of congestion. Review your plan for details.\nWhat happens if I already have a subscription to a perk?\nIt depends on the perk and the current subscription you have. You may need to manage your existing subscription to activate a perk. Please see the specific perk FAQs on what happens with existing subscriptions: Disney Bundle, Netflix® & Max (With Ads), Apple One, Apple Music, Walmart+, 2 TB Cloud Storage, Smartwatch Data & Safety and Three TravelPass Days perk FAQs.\nHow do I bring my phone number to Verizon from another carrier?\nWhen you activate a new line with Verizon you'll have the option to transfer your current mobile or landline number from another carrier.\nYou can also visit our Switch to Verizon page online, contact us or visit a store to transfer your number to Verizon.\n- Unlimited Ultimate: Unlimited mobile hotspot data: After 200 GB of Premium Data, Unlimited thereafter at 6 Mbps.

It's an unlimited number of GBs. Depending on which plan you select, your speeds may be slower in times of congestion. Review your plan for details. What happens if I already have a subscription to a perk?\nIt depends on the perk and the current subscription you have. You may need to manage your existing subscription to activate a perk. Please see the specific perk FAQs on what happens with existing subscriptions: Disney Bundle, Netflix® & Max (With Ads), Apple One, Apple Music, Walmart+, 2 TB Cloud Storage, Smartwatch Data & Safety and Three TravelPass Days perk FAQs.
