We’ve got answers.\nCan I keep my current Verizon wireless plan?\nYes, users with an existing plan can keep their current plan. However, if you're on an existing Mix & Match or Welcome Unlimited plan you can choose to switch one or all of your lines to myPlan at any time. All other plans must switch all of their lines if moving to myPlan.\nWhat are the differences between Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome?\nAll of Verizon's Unlimited plans include unlimited talk, text, and data, as well as 5G (or 4G LTE in areas where 5G isn't available), Mexico and Canada talk, text and data, as well as International texting. Unlimited plans have access to Verizon's 3-year price lock guarantee along with a phone upgrade.\nUnlimited Welcome gives you Verizon's reliable, fast 5G and the Welcome Phone Upgrade for new and existing customers.\nWith Unlimited Plus, you get our fastest 5G and access to 30 GB of Premium unlimited mobile hotspot data per month, then unlimited thereafter at 3 Mbps on 5G Ultra Wideband and 600 Kbps on 5G/4G LTE to power your other devices on the go.\nVerizon's Unlimited Ultimate offers 200 GB of premium data (unlimited thereafter at 6 Mbps) and unlimited calling and texting from 200+ countries. In addition to unlimited calling, you get enhanced video calling which has optimized video and sound quality on video calling apps in times of network congestion, when it matters most. With Unlimited Ultimate you also get 15 GB international roaming data a month, then unlimited thereafter at 1.5 mbps, and the ability to turn on 1080p HD with streaming quality of up to 4K Ultra High Definition when you’re using 5G Ultra Wideband network on a capable device.\nCheck out our latest promotions and offers.\nCan I mix and match between Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome?\nActivating more than one line?

Just choose the plan you'd like for each specific line, for up to 12 lines, when you sign up for myPlan. Learn more.\nWhat are the benefits of adding a perk through Verizon?\nSave every month - check out the price savings on your favorite monthly subscriptions. Additionally, by adding perks to your plan through Verizon, you can manage those perks and subscriptions all in one place. For example, if you sign up for one of the available perk memberships, you can manage the membership through your Verizon bill and keep track of those charges all in one place.\nWill new perks be added?\nYes– keep checking back for new, updated perks. Since you aren't locked in with myPlan to any specific contract, you can add new perks or change them at any time. Just one of the many benefits of our new Unlimited plans!\nWhat is data on a cell phone plan?\nWhen you aren't connected to Wi-Fi, you connect to the internet using data. So, if you're logging onto the web but not connected to Wi-Fi, your phone will require a data plan. This includes while using apps that require an internet connection, such as social media apps and certain mobile games, etc.\nWhat is an unlimited data plan?\nSome cell phone plans limit the amount of data you can use per month (measured in gigabytes, or \"GB\"), while an unlimited data plan doesn't limit you. It's an unlimited number of GBs. Depending on which plan you select, your speeds may be slower in times of congestion. Review your plan for details.\nWhat happens if I already have a subscription to a perk?\nIt depends on the perk and the current subscription you have. You may need to manage your existing subscription to activate a perk. Please see the specific perk FAQs on what happens with existing subscriptions: Disney Bundle, Netflix® & Max (With Ads), Apple One, Apple Music, Walmart+, 2 TB Cloud Storage, Smartwatch Data & Safety and Three TravelPass Days perk FAQs.\nHow do I bring my phone number to Verizon from another carrier?\nWhen you activate a new line with Verizon you'll have the option to transfer your current mobile or landline number from another carrier.\nYou can also visit our Switch to Verizon page online, contact us or visit a store to transfer your number to Verizon.\n- Unlimited Ultimate: Unlimited mobile hotspot data: After 200 GB of Premium Data, Unlimited thereafter at 6 Mbps.

Additionally, by adding perks to your plan through Verizon, you can manage those perks and subscriptions all in one place. For example, if you sign up for one of the available perk memberships, you can manage the membership through your Verizon bill and keep track of those charges all in one place. Will new perks be added?\nYes– keep checking back for new, updated perks. Since you aren't locked in with myPlan to any specific contract, you can add new perks or change them at any time. Just one of the many benefits of our new Unlimited plans!\nWhat is data on a cell phone plan?\nWhen you aren't connected to Wi-Fi, you connect to the internet using data. So, if you're logging onto the web but not connected to Wi-Fi, your phone will require a data plan. This includes while using apps that require an internet connection, such as social media apps and certain mobile games, etc. What is an unlimited data plan?\nSome cell phone plans limit the amount of data you can use per month (measured in gigabytes, or \"GB\"), while an unlimited data plan doesn't limit you. It's an unlimited number of GBs. Depending on which plan you select, your speeds may be slower in times of congestion. Review your plan for details. What happens if I already have a subscription to a perk?\nIt depends on the perk and the current subscription you have. You may need to manage your existing subscription to activate a perk. Please see the specific perk FAQs on what happens with existing subscriptions: Disney Bundle, Netflix® & Max (With Ads), Apple One, Apple Music, Walmart+, 2 TB Cloud Storage, Smartwatch Data & Safety and Three TravelPass Days perk FAQs. How do I bring my phone number to Verizon from another carrier?\nWhen you activate a new line with Verizon you'll have the option to transfer your current mobile or landline number from another carrier.

Similar to your smartphone, a hotspot device uses a cellular signal to connect to the internet. While many smartphones come with a built in hotspot, there may be some situations where your phone doesn't offer a strong enough connection for what you need to do online.\nIn those times when you need a strong, reliable connection for your devices, you can use a portable hotspot. A portable hotspot is a device that allows you to create a secure Wi-Fi network and connect all your devices to your safe, password protected private network. Additionally, we offer data plans to make sure you can stay connected even when you're on the go.\nPortable hotspots are a much more reliable way to connect to the internet, as one of the biggest risks when using public Wi-Fi is that it can be unsecured. This means that your device is vulnerable to hackers, and they have the ability to steal your personal information or install harmful software without you knowing. If keeping your data safe is a top priority, purchasing a hotspot may be in your best interest.\nIn order to use your hotspot, you will need a hotspot data plan. You can either purchase your portable hotspot device directly from Verizon, choosing from top brands like Inseego, Orbic, and TCL, or you can bring your own to our network. We currently have four different hotspot data plans available, Essential, Plus, Pro and Premium, giving you plenty of options to choose what works best for your budget and personal needs. If you're on a prepaid plan, we offer prepaid hotspots and other internet devices.\nOnce you have your hotspot and data plan, you will want to charge your portable device and activate it through the manufacturer's instructions. After completing the activation and ensuring you have a data plan, your device is ready to be used. The device name and passcode should be provided either on the device or within the instructions, and you will use that information to connect to your smartphone, laptop, or other device. And just like that, you are connected to the internet!\nHotspots are becoming more popular in the work-from-anywhere era, and you have plenty of options to choose from with Verizon. No matter which hotspot device and data plan you choose, you can know that you will be safely connected to the internet.",

Modern wearable technology can become an asset to those who want to monitor their heart rate, keep an eye on their daily movement levels (to avoid being too sedentary), and even show message and call notifications from your smartphone when synced up.\nThe possibilities don't end there, but you may be wondering which fitness tracker is right for you. From brands like Fitbit to Spibelt, there are certainly many options to choose from.\nFitbit wearable fitness trackers may be the most well known fitness watch brand on the market, boasting impressive features such as heart rate monitoring, step count and calorie counting, smartphone syncing capabilities, distance run tracking, and much more. Fitbit comes in a variety of models that offer different sizes and styles to the user, so you can choose which fits your lifestyle best. And, with the smartphone syncing features, you can see your total health dashboard right on your smartphone with the Fitbit app, allowing you to monitor your wellness metrics wherever you are.\nSPIbelt fitness belts are another great choice for those who want to track and measure their fitness goals on their smartphone (but don't want to carry it around in their hands). These wearable belts come with pockets and holders allowing you to keep your smartphone and other necessities on your person while completing your favorite workout routine.\nNo matter which wearable fitness device you choose, you're sure to dominate your health goals with these handy devices and tools at your disposal. From tracking (and crushing!) your daily step goals to wearing your smartphone more comfortably while you work out, Verizon has great options for everyone looking to take their health into their own hands.",

We’ve got answers.\nHave questions?\nWe’ve got answers.\nWhat is Fios Home Internet?\nVerizon Fios is a 100% fiber-optic network that delivers some of the fastest internet speeds to millions of homes in the mid-Atlantic and New England. It uses fiber optics to transmit data at the speed of light, providing a fast, reliable internet connection and powerful bandwidth for multiple devices. Verizon is one of the only internet service providers to offer nearly matching download and upload speeds on most plans, which is a major benefit when you’re video chatting, gaming and working from home.\nWhy should I consider Fios?\nFios 1 Gig means ultra-ultra-fast internet with the power of massive capacity, because using fiber results in a greater uploading capacity. So you can have more bandwidth for everyone in your home at the same time. Fios offers enough bandwidth for everyone. Our newest tri-band router with Wi-Fi 6 has some of the highest bandwidth, so the whole family can be connected at the same time.\nFios also has ultra-low latency, which can mean smoother video connections and ultra-low lag when gaming. Plus, Fios has been the most awarded network for internet speed and customer satisfaction over the past 10 years. The Fios network provides high reliability, plus ultra-fast speeds, massive capacity and virtually no buffering.\nFios TV offers you multiple options. Pick the TV package that works for you, with no surcharges, broadcast or regional sports network fees.\nAlso consider getting Fios Digital Voice as a landline. Reinvent your landline phone with advanced calling features and unlimited local and long-distance calling within the U.S. International calling to 98% of the world's population included.\nWhat is fiber-optic internet?\nFiber optics is a sophisticated high-speed internet technology that sends light through tiny strands of glass to carry data directly to your home at accelerated speeds. These light signals travel faster than the electrical pulses used by copper cabling. And while some cable providers now use fiber in their lines, the Fios network is made of 100% fiber-optic.\nIs fiber internet better than cable?\nUnlike the copper coax lines used by most high speed internet providers, fiber internet service is powered by technology that uses light to deliver a fast and reliable connection. And with multiple users and devices at home, fiber-optic home internet is the answer for getting the bandwidth and power you need to run lots of devices at the same time with less lag and buffering than cable. When shopping around for internet services, keep in mind the many advantages of fiber optics to the home.\nHow fast is a fiber connection?\nFiber remains one of the fastest internet technologies currently available for home internet service. In November 2020, the US had an average download speed of 170.88 Mbps for fixed broadband (not mobile)*. That kind of speed is entry level for Verizon Fios, because its plans start at a strong 300 Mbps and climb to impressive speeds up to 940/880 Mbps with a Fios 1 Gig plan – making it among the fastest internet services around. You can download an HD movie before the popcorn is ready with speeds nearing a gigabit, just to give you an idea how fast that is. How fast is your current home internet plan? Check your speed now.\nDoes fiber-optic internet have Wi-Fi for home included?\nYes, Fios fiber-optic home internet can provide Wi-Fi for your home. With Verizon Fios as your wireless home internet service provider and the next-generation Wi-Fi 6 Fios Router installed in your home, you'll enjoy lightning fast speeds for your connected devices.\nWill fiber optics make my Wi-Fi and internet service faster?\nFios is a 100% fiber-optic network that delivers some of the fastest internet speeds to millions of homes. It uses fiber optics to transmit data at the speed of light, providing a fast internet connection and powerful bandwidth for multiple devices, whether wired or wireless. Verizon Fios is one of the only internet service providers to offer nearly matching download and upload speeds on most plans, which is a major advantage when you’re video chatting, gaming and sharing large files or images.\nHow much does Wi-Fi from Verizon Fios Home Internet cost?\nYour monthly cost depends on which Fios internet plan you pick. There are no annual contracts, taxes or hidden fees, and a router rental is included at no extra charge. Unlike some other providers, adding a new Fios internet plan will give you a multi-year price guarantee. So you don't have to worry about unexpected price hikes. See the plan details for more pricing information.\nWhat affordable Verizon Home Internet options are available?\nVerizon participated in ACP, the Affordable Connectivity Program, while the program was active prior to the last fully funded month of April 2024. Verizon now provides reduced-cost internet to eligible new or existing home Internet customers who have qualified for Lifeline, SNAP, WIC, and other assistance programs within 180 days of application or received a Federal Pell Grant within the past year with our Verizon Forward program. Qualifying customers receive a service discount on their Fios, 5G Home or LTE Home Internet plan price. Learn more here.\nWhat are Verizon Whole-Home Wi-Fi and Verizon Whole Home Wi-Fi Plus?\nWhole-Home Wi-Fi is included with your 5G Home Ultimate* or LTE Home Plus wireless home internet plan. When you have Whole-Home Wi-Fi, you can choose to upgrade to Whole-Home Wi-Fi Plus for $5/month (plus taxes & surcharges).\nVerizon Whole-Home Wi-Fi** and Verizon Whole-Home Wi-Fi Plus** include 3 features that help improve Wi-Fi coverage in your home:\n- Wi-Fi Health Check in the My Verizon app to optimize your Wi-Fi network.\n- Wi-Fi extender(s):***\n- Whole-Home Wi-Fi gives you 1 optional Wi-Fi extender for better signal strength in hard-to-reach places.\n- Whole-Home Wi-Fi Plus gives you a total of 3 Wi-Fi extenders per line. 2 are sent with your order.

We’ve got answers. Have questions?\nWe’ve got answers. What is Fios Home Internet?\nVerizon Fios is a 100% fiber-optic network that delivers some of the fastest internet speeds to millions of homes in the mid-Atlantic and New England. It uses fiber optics to transmit data at the speed of light, providing a fast, reliable internet connection and powerful bandwidth for multiple devices. Verizon is one of the only internet service providers to offer nearly matching download and upload speeds on most plans, which is a major benefit when you’re video chatting, gaming and working from home. Why should I consider Fios?\nFios 1 Gig means ultra-ultra-fast internet with the power of massive capacity, because using fiber results in a greater uploading capacity. So you can have more bandwidth for everyone in your home at the same time. Fios offers enough bandwidth for everyone. Our newest tri-band router with Wi-Fi 6 has some of the highest bandwidth, so the whole family can be connected at the same time. Fios also has ultra-low latency, which can mean smoother video connections and ultra-low lag when gaming. Plus, Fios has been the most awarded network for internet speed and customer satisfaction over the past 10 years. The Fios network provides high reliability, plus ultra-fast speeds, massive capacity and virtually no buffering. Fios TV offers you multiple options. Pick the TV package that works for you, with no surcharges, broadcast or regional sports network fees. Also consider getting Fios Digital Voice as a landline. Reinvent your landline phone with advanced calling features and unlimited local and long-distance calling within the U. S. International calling to 98% of the world's population included. What is fiber-optic internet?\nFiber optics is a sophisticated high-speed internet technology that sends light through tiny strands of glass to carry data directly to your home at accelerated speeds. These light signals travel faster than the electrical pulses used by copper cabling. And while some cable providers now use fiber in their lines, the Fios network is made of 100% fiber-optic. Is fiber internet better than cable?\nUnlike the copper coax lines used by most high speed internet providers, fiber internet service is powered by technology that uses light to deliver a fast and reliable connection. And with multiple users and devices at home, fiber-optic home internet is the answer for getting the bandwidth and power you need to run lots of devices at the same time with less lag and buffering than cable. When shopping around for internet services, keep in mind the many advantages of fiber optics to the home. How fast is a fiber connection?\nFiber remains one of the fastest internet technologies currently available for home internet service. In November 2020, the US had an average download speed of 170. 88 Mbps for fixed broadband (not mobile)*. That kind of speed is entry level for Verizon Fios, because its plans start at a strong 300 Mbps and climb to impressive speeds up to 940/880 Mbps with a Fios 1 Gig plan – making it among the fastest internet services around. You can download an HD movie before the popcorn is ready with speeds nearing a gigabit, just to give you an idea how fast that is. How fast is your current home internet plan? Check your speed now. Does fiber-optic internet have Wi-Fi for home included?\nYes, Fios fiber-optic home internet can provide Wi-Fi for your home.",

Verizon Fios is one of the only internet service providers to offer nearly matching download and upload speeds on most plans, which is a major advantage when you’re video chatting, gaming and sharing large files or images.

Each device you add will use some of your internet bandwidth, and some devices (like home security devices or smart home devices) function in the background without you thinking about them. This is why review sites like Tom's Guide recommend you get an internet speed of 200 Mbps or higher if your household has more than one person, or if you like to game or stream content.\nWhat affordable Verizon Home Internet options are available?\nVerizon participated in ACP, the Affordable Connectivity Program, while the program was active prior to the last fully funded month of April 2024. Verizon now provides reduced-cost internet to eligible new or existing home Internet customers who have qualified for Lifeline, SNAP, WIC, and other assistance programs within 180 days of application or received a Federal Pell Grant within the past year with our Verizon Forward program. Qualifying customers receive a service discount on their Fios, 5G Home or LTE Home Internet plan price. Learn more here.",
