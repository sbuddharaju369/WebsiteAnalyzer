We’ve got answers.\nCan I move my current Verizon Home Internet service to a new address?\nVerizon has made it easy for you to stay connected while you start your new adventure. For existing Fios customers, please click here to sign in to your account. For existing 5G Home Internet or LTE Home Internet customers, please click here to sign in to your account. We'll help you find out if we offer internet service at your new home and how to transfer it if we do.\nWhat internet is available at my address?\nFor Verizon Home Internet availability, it's all about the internet technology, how it's delivered to your home and where you live. Fios provides 100% fiber-optic internet with supercharged speeds and is widely available in metro and suburban areas of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. 5G Home Internet is now in more and more places around the country and is fast, reliable home internet so you can game, stream and connect the way you want.* LTE Home Internet uses the wireless 4G LTE network to deliver home broadband internet service to your residence.\nTo see which Verizon home internet service is available where you live, check availability.\n*5G Home/LTE Home Internet services provided through cellular network; speeds vary due to factors affecting cellular networks\nI'm moving and Verizon internet is available at my new address. Do I need to pay an installation fee?\nYou're in luck. For 5G Home and LTE Home service, you can set up the equipment on your own, at no cost. In some areas, 5G Home professional assistance may be available for an additional charge.\nTo transfer your Fios internet service to a new home, log in to your account to let us know that you will be moving. There may be an installation or setup charge when your new service is installed.\nWhen should I set up Verizon Home Internet at my new home?\nWe recommend placing your order for Fios internet service two weeks in advance of moving into your new home, and we're here to make the process fast and easy. If you've already moved in, you can get started right now. Verizon offers evening and weekend appointments (in most areas) for Fios. Equipment for 5G Home and LTE Home will be sent to you for self-setup. It may take 2-4 days to arrive after you place your order.\nWhat internet speed do I need when I’m moving to a new home?\nYour ideal internet speed will depend on how you are using the internet. According to a 2021 Deloitte survey, the average household has 25 devices connected to their Wi-Fi network. Each device you add will use some of your internet bandwidth, and some devices (like home security devices or smart home devices) function in the background without you thinking about them. This is why review sites like Tom's Guide recommend you get an internet speed of 200 Mbps or higher if your household has more than one person, or if you like to game or stream content.\nWhat affordable Verizon Home Internet options are available?\nVerizon participated in ACP, the Affordable Connectivity Program, while the program was active prior to the last fully funded month of April 2024. Verizon now provides reduced-cost internet to eligible new or existing home Internet customers who have qualified for Lifeline, SNAP, WIC, and other assistance programs within 180 days of application or received a Federal Pell Grant within the past year with our Verizon Forward program. Qualifying customers receive a service discount on their Fios, 5G Home or LTE Home Internet plan price. Learn more here.",

The following consumer information addresses commonly asked questions about the health effects of wireless phones.\nAre Wireless Phones Safe?\nScientific research on the subject of wireless phones and radio frequency (\"RF\") energy has been conducted worldwide for many years, and continues. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") set policies and procedures for wireless phones. The FDA and the FCC have created a joint website, \"Cell Phone Facts - Consumer Information on Wireless Phones,\" which states that \"[t]he available scientific evidence does not show that any health problems are associated with using wireless phones,\" while noting that \"[t]here is no proof, however, that wireless phones are absolutely safe.\" You can access the joint FDA/FCC website at https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/radiationemittingproductsandprocedures/homebusinessandentertainment/cellphones/default.htm. You can also contact the FDA toll-free at (888) 463-6332 or (888) INFO-FDA. In June 2000, the FDA entered into a cooperative research and development agreement through which additional scientific research will be conducted. The FCC issued its own website publication stating that \"[t]here is no scientific evidence that proves that wireless phone usage can lead to cancer or a variety of other problems, including headaches, dizziness or memory loss.\" This publication is available at http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/mobilephone.html or through the FCC at (888) 225-5322 or (888) CALL-FCC.\nIn 1996, the FCC, working with the FDA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, established RF exposure safety guidelines for wireless phones in the United States. Before a wireless phone model is available for sale to the public, it must be tested by the manufacturer and certified to the FCC that it does not exceed limits established by the FCC. One of these limits is expressed as a Specific Absorption Rate, or \"SAR\". SAR is a measure of the rate of absorption of RF energy in the body. Tests for SAR are conducted with the phone transmitting at its highest power level in all tested frequency bands. Since 1996, the FCC has required that the SAR of handheld wireless phones not exceed 1.6 watts per kilogram, averaged over one gram of tissue. Although the SAR is determined at the highest power level, the actual SAR value of a wireless phone while operating can be less than the reported SAR value. This is because the SAR value may vary from call to call, depending on factors such as proximity to a cell site, the proximity of the phone to the body while in use, and the use of hands-free devices. For more information about SARs, see the FCC's OET Bulletins 56 and 65 at https://www.fcc.gov/general/oet-bulletins-line and http://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/. You may also wish to contact the manufacturer of your phone.\nCan I Minimize My RF Exposure?\nIf you are concerned about RF, there are several simple steps you can take to minimize your RF exposure. You can, of course, reduce your talk time. You can place more distance between your body and the source of the RF, as the exposure level drops off dramatically with distance. The FDA/FCC website states that \"[h]ands-free kits can be used with wireless phones for convenience and comfort. These systems reduce the absorption of RF energy in the head because the phone, which is the source of the RF emissions, will not be placed against the head. On the other hand, if the phone is mounted against the waist or other part of the body during use, then that part of the body will absorb more RF energy. Wireless phones marketed in the U.S. are required to meet safety requirements regardless of whether they are used against the head or against the body. Either configuration should result in compliance with the safety limit.\" Also, if you use your wireless phone while in a car, you can use a phone with an antenna on the outside of the vehicle. You should also read and follow your wireless phone manufacturer’s instructions for the safe operation of your phone.\nDo Wireless Phones Pose Any Special Risks to Children?\nThe FDA/FCC website states that \"[t]he scientific evidence does not show a danger to users of wireless communication devices including children.\" The FDA/FCC website further states that \"[s]ome groups sponsored by other national governments have advised that children be discouraged from using wireless phones at all. For example, the government in the United Kingdom [\"UK\"] distributed leaflets containing such a recommendation in December 2000. [The UK] noted that no evidence exists that using a wireless phone causes brain tumors or other ill effects. [The UK’s] recommendation to limit wireless phone use by children was strictly precautionary; it was not based on scientific evidence that any health hazard exists.\" A copy of the UK’s leaflet is available at http://www.dh.gov.uk (search \"mobile\"), or you can write to: NRPB, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 0RQ, United Kingdom. Copies of UK’s annual reports on mobile phones and RF are available online at http://www.iegmp.org.uk and http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/ (search \"mobile\"). Parents who wish to reduce their children’s RF exposure may choose to restrict their children’s wireless phone use.\nWhere Can I Obtain Further Information?\nFor further information, see the following additional resources:\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nFDA Consumer magazine\nNovember-December 2000\nTelephone: (888) INFO-FDA\nhttps://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/radiationemittingproductsandprocedures/medicalimaging/medicalx-rays/ucm115332.htm\nU.S. Federal Communications Commission\n445 12th St. S.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20554\nTelephone: (888) 225-5322\nhttp://www.fcc.gov/oet/rfsafety\nIndependent Expert Group on Mobile Phones\nRoyal Society of Canada\nExpert Panel on Potential Health Risks of Radiofrequency Fields from Wireless Telecommunications Devices\n283 Sparks Street\nOttawa, Ontario K1R 7X9\nCanada\nTelephone: (613) 991-6990\nhttp://www.rsc.ca/index.php?page=expert_panels_rf&lang_id=1&page_id=120\nWorld Health Organization\nAvenue Appia 20\n1211 Geneva 27\nSwitzerland\nTelephone: 011 41 22 791 21 11\nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en/\nInternational Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection\nc/o Bundesamt fur Strahlenschutz\nIngolstaedter Landstr.1\n85764 Oberschleissheim\nGermany\nTelephone: 011 49 1888 333 2156\nhttps://www.icnirp.org/\nAmerican National Standards Institute\n1819 L Street, N.W., 6th Floor\nWashington, D.C. 20036\n(202) 293-8020\nhttp://www.ansi.org\nNational Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements\n7910 Woodmont Avenue, Suite 800\nBethesda, MD 20814-3095\nTelephone: (301) 657-2652\nhttp://www.ncrponline.org",

Can I get one for my device?\nConnected device plans are monthly data plans for your non-phone devices (i.e., mobile hotspot devices*, USB modems, tablets, laptops, smartwatches, security cameras, in-car Wi-Fi and more).\nYou can get a connected device plan(s) if your Verizon mobile account has either:\n- No phone plans - you'll pay the \"standalone\" plan price\nException: To get our Essential or Plus plans for mobile hotspot devices and USB Modems your account must have at least one unlimited phone plan that can be mixed and matched**, One Unlimited for iPhone**, Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Welcome. - At least one unlimited mobile phone plan.\nNote: If you have a shared data plan***, you don't need a separate plan for your non-phone device because the device can share your plan's data. A $10/month line access fee is charged for each connected device sharing your monthly data.\n*Mobile hotspot devices are different from the mobile hotspot app or built-in feature in smartphones and tablets. Visit our Mobile hotspot feature and app FAQs to learn more.\n**These plans are no longer available to add to your account.\n***Shared data plans are no longer available to add to your account.\nHow many connected devices can I have on my Verizon mobile account?\nYou can add up to 12 smartphones or basic phones to your Verizon mobile account with any plan that allows for multiple lines of service. And you can have up to 30 total devices per account.\nThat means if you have 10 phone lines, you can have up to 20 connected devices (e.g., tablet, smartwatch, streaming camera, etc.).\nNote:\n- If you have an unlimited monthly phone plan, each connected device must have its own data plan.\n- If you have a shared data* monthly phone plan, the connected devices can share that data.\n*Shared data plans are no longer available to add to your account.\nHow much does a connected device plan cost?\nYour connected device plan's monthly cost depends on:\n- The connected device type (e.g, laptop, mobile hotspot device, smartwatch, etc.).\n- Whether or not you already have a Verizon phone line.\n- Whether or not you already have any phones on an Unlimited monthly mobile plan, and which Unlimited plan you have.\n- How many non-phone devices you're adding to your mobile account.\n- The plan you choose. Connected device plans differ in monthly data amounts and features (i.e., streaming speed, 5G Ultra Wideband).\nVisit our connected device plans page and choose a device type to view plans and their monthly costs.\nHow do I get a connected device plan?\nVisit our connected device plans page to view plan options for your device. Choose Shop or Bring your own to get started. Follow the steps to add a plan and device to your account.\nNote: When you have a shared data plan*, your connected devices don't need a separate plan. They can share your phone plan's monthly data amount. A $10/month line access fee is charged for each connected device that shares your monthly data. Or, you can add a monthly plan that's just for your connected device.\n*Shared data plans are no longer available to add to your account.",

This includes turning off devices that are connected as well as not using your computer or device while running the test.\nVerizon’s speed test checks how fast information travels from our servers to your device. Results are often lower than plan speeds due to Wi-Fi conditions and device capabilities. This test is intended to measure results on your home network, and should not be used on public Wi-Fi or cellular networks.\nYou can use the test above to test your Wi-Fi connection. If your speed comes back slow, try getting closer to the router or connecting your device to the router with an ethernet cable. Wired connections (by ethernet cable) are generally faster than Wi-Fi connections.\nNo. Wi-Fi signal strength is different from internet speed. To learn more about your Wi-Fi signal strength and troubleshoot problems, visit our support pages.\nYou use the internet to both send and receive information. The download speed score shows how long it takes to download or receive information, while the upload test measures how long it takes to send information through the internet. Our speed test measures and reports on both.\nThe FCC’s standard for broadband internet is a download speed of at least 25 Mbps and upload speed of at least 3 Mbps. But the best way to determine how much speed you need is to think about your data needs. The average household now has 25 connected devices, from laptops and smartphones to smart TVs, headphones and gaming consoles. With so many devices, faster speeds and more bandwidth work best. Explore Verizon’s speed plans and see what internet options are available in your area.\nThere are several factors that might affect your internet speed, including how many devices you have connected, whether you’re using Wi-Fi or an ethernet cable, and even the device you’re using to connect.
