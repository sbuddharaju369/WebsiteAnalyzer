We’ve got answers.\nHave questions?\nWe’ve got answers.\nWhat is Fios Home Internet?\nVerizon Fios is a 100% fiber-optic network that delivers some of the fastest internet speeds to millions of homes in the mid-Atlantic and New England. It uses fiber optics to transmit data at the speed of light, providing a fast, reliable internet connection and powerful bandwidth for multiple devices. Verizon is one of the only internet service providers to offer nearly matching download and upload speeds on most plans, which is a major benefit when you’re video chatting, gaming and working from home.\nWhy should I consider Fios?\nFios 1 Gig means ultra-ultra-fast internet with the power of massive capacity, because using fiber results in a greater uploading capacity. So you can have more bandwidth for everyone in your home at the same time. Fios offers enough bandwidth for everyone. Our newest tri-band router with Wi-Fi 6 has some of the highest bandwidth, so the whole family can be connected at the same time.\nFios also has ultra-low latency, which can mean smoother video connections and ultra-low lag when gaming. Plus, Fios has been the most awarded network for internet speed and customer satisfaction over the past 10 years. The Fios network provides high reliability, plus ultra-fast speeds, massive capacity and virtually no buffering.\nFios TV offers you multiple options. Pick the TV package that works for you, with no surcharges, broadcast or regional sports network fees.\nAlso consider getting Fios Digital Voice as a landline. Reinvent your landline phone with advanced calling features and unlimited local and long-distance calling within the U.S. International calling to 98% of the world's population included.\nWhat is fiber-optic internet?\nFiber optics is a sophisticated high-speed internet technology that sends light through tiny strands of glass to carry data directly to your home at accelerated speeds. These light signals travel faster than the electrical pulses used by copper cabling. And while some cable providers now use fiber in their lines, the Fios network is made of 100% fiber-optic.\nIs fiber internet better than cable?\nUnlike the copper coax lines used by most high speed internet providers, fiber internet service is powered by technology that uses light to deliver a fast and reliable connection. And with multiple users and devices at home, fiber-optic home internet is the answer for getting the bandwidth and power you need to run lots of devices at the same time with less lag and buffering than cable. When shopping around for internet services, keep in mind the many advantages of fiber optics to the home.\nHow fast is a fiber connection?\nFiber remains one of the fastest internet technologies currently available for home internet service. In November 2020, the US had an average download speed of 170.88 Mbps for fixed broadband (not mobile)*. That kind of speed is entry level for Verizon Fios, because its plans start at a strong 300 Mbps and climb to impressive speeds up to 940/880 Mbps with a Fios 1 Gig plan – making it among the fastest internet services around. You can download an HD movie before the popcorn is ready with speeds nearing a gigabit, just to give you an idea how fast that is. How fast is your current home internet plan? Check your speed now.\nDoes fiber-optic internet have Wi-Fi for home included?\nYes, Fios fiber-optic home internet can provide Wi-Fi for your home. With Verizon Fios as your wireless home internet service provider and the next-generation Wi-Fi 6 Fios Router installed in your home, you'll enjoy lightning fast speeds for your connected devices.\nWill fiber optics make my Wi-Fi and internet service faster?\nFios is a 100% fiber-optic network that delivers some of the fastest internet speeds to millions of homes. It uses fiber optics to transmit data at the speed of light, providing a fast internet connection and powerful bandwidth for multiple devices, whether wired or wireless. Verizon Fios is one of the only internet service providers to offer nearly matching download and upload speeds on most plans, which is a major advantage when you’re video chatting, gaming and sharing large files or images.\nHow much does Wi-Fi from Verizon Fios Home Internet cost?\nYour monthly cost depends on which Fios internet plan you pick. There are no annual contracts, taxes or hidden fees, and a router rental is included at no extra charge. Unlike some other providers, adding a new Fios internet plan will give you a multi-year price guarantee. So you don't have to worry about unexpected price hikes. See the plan details for more pricing information.\nWhat affordable Verizon Home Internet options are available?\nVerizon participated in ACP, the Affordable Connectivity Program, while the program was active prior to the last fully funded month of April 2024. Verizon now provides reduced-cost internet to eligible new or existing home Internet customers who have qualified for Lifeline, SNAP, WIC, and other assistance programs within 180 days of application or received a Federal Pell Grant within the past year with our Verizon Forward program. Qualifying customers receive a service discount on their Fios, 5G Home or LTE Home Internet plan price. Learn more here.\nWhat are Verizon Whole-Home Wi-Fi and Verizon Whole Home Wi-Fi Plus?\nVerizon Whole-Home Wi-Fi* and Verizon Whole-Home Wi-FI Plus* include 2 features that help you improve Wi-Fi coverage in your home:\n- Wi-Fi Health Check in the My Verizon app to optimize your Wi-Fi network.\n- Wi-Fi extender(s):**\n- Whole-Home Wi-Fi gives you one optional Wi-Fi extender for better signal strength in hard-to-reach places.\n- Whole-Home Wi-Fi Plus includes up to 3 Wi-Fi extenders.

      "content": "You may return or exchange wireless devices and accessories purchased from Verizon within 30 days of purchase. A restocking fee of $50 (plus any applicable taxes) applies to any return or exchange of a wireless device (excluding Hawaii). If you purchased your device at a non-Verizon owned/operated retail location (Authorized Retailer), that location may have its own return/exchange policy which governs the acceptance of device returns and exchanges. Retain and review your receipt to determine whether you purchased from Verizon or an Authorized Retailer.\nYou are permitted to make one exchange. To make an exchange, return the merchandise (including device, charger, battery, instructions, and any other components) in the ORIGINAL box. All merchandise must be in like-new condition and accompanied by the original receipt. Shipping charges may apply to exchange merchandise sent to you by Verizon.\nDevices must be returned within the 30 day device return period to avoid being assessed any applicable Early Termination Fee which may apply if your line of service has a minimum contract term. Please review your service summary receipt and Customer Agreement to determine if an Early Termination Fee may apply.\nIf you return your merchandise, even by mistake, after the return period, you will not receive a refund and the merchandise you returned will not be returned to you. If you received promotional value when trading a device, and/or instant savings towards the purchase of a new device at the time of your trade, you agree that you will be charged for these values if you do not maintain active service on your new device for three billing cycles. Verizon will also charge back any promotional Trade in value if you return your promotional device, or exchange it for another device.\nAt our discretion, we may decline your return or charge you a fee for a missing item, or for items that we determine are damaged or require service. If you return and we accept your merchandise within the return period, we will refund your purchase price, subject to the restocking fee. If you return a wireless device without a UPC on the box, the amount of the refund will be reduced by the amount of any mail-in rebate that was available for the wireless device at the time of purchase. Purchases made by cash or check, credit card or gift card will be refunded by check, credit card or gift card, respectively. If you return a purchase that you billed to your wireless account, refunds will be credited towards your wireless account.\nIf you received your merchandise through a \"Buy One, Get One Free\" or similar offer and return only one of the items, your promotional offer will be canceled and a charge will appear on your next month's bill for any promotional benefit associated with the offer. If a device purchased as part of a BOGO offer is being exchanged for the same make and model, only the item that is being exchanged needs to be returned. For additional information, please see the terms and conditions of the promotional offer.\nIf Verizon must remove installed equipment from a vehicle or fixed location in order to return or exchange it, you will be charged a service fee.\nOpened software purchased separately may be exchanged only for the exact same item at a Verizon Communications Store and may not be returned for refund.\nBefore returning or exchanging any wireless device or accessory that has data in its memory, please transfer all data you wish to retain to another file source. Once the wireless device or accessory is returned, your data cannot be recovered.\nAdditionally, you should retain or destroy any removable or portable memory cards or modules (such as a SIM Card or SD Card) in order to help protect sensitive information, such as mobile banking information.\nBecause the FCC requires that nearly all wireless devices on a carrier's network have GPS capability, Verizon does not allow non-GPS wireless devices to be activated on our network. If you upgrade from a non-GPS capable wireless device to a GPS capable wireless device and then return it within the return period, Verizon will not allow the older non-GPS capable wireless device back on our network. We will, however, allow you to exchange your new wireless device for another GPS capable wireless device that will meet your needs, subject to the restocking fee.\nIf after you purchased your merchandise, you received the merchandise by mail from Verizon or you picked up the merchandise from a Verizon store, you can return/exchange your merchandise through My Verizon, by contacting Verizon Customer Service or by visiting a Verizon store, unless you received with your merchandise different instructions in which case you have to follow those instructions. If you purchased your merchandise in a Verizon store, you can return it to any Verizon store. If you purchased your merchandise from an Authorized Retailer and you did not receive your merchandise by mail from Verizon or you did not pick up your merchandise from a Verizon store, you must return it to or exchange it with that Authorized Retailer in accordance with their return/exchange policy. Please search Return Policy on verizon.com for more details. Returning your merchandise does not automatically terminate your service. You must call Customer Service to cancel service.",

Find out what your speed test results mean.\nView internet speed test FAQsInternet speed tips\nA number of factors can affect your internet speed test. Follow our helpful tips to ensure you’re getting the most from your internet speed.\nSee internet speed tipsSpeed tests explained\nThere are many kinds of internet speed tests, so it’s important to understand them when you check your internet speed.\nRead more about internet speed testsFor the most accurate result, connect your device directly to your router using an ethernet cable (if possible), disconnect from any VPNs, and avoid using video or music streaming apps while running the test.\nYes, to get a more accurate reading you should limit your use of the internet while conducting the test. This includes turning off devices that are connected as well as not using your computer or device while running the test.\nVerizon’s speed test checks how fast information travels from our servers to your device. Results are often lower than plan speeds due to Wi-Fi conditions and device capabilities. This test is intended to measure results on your home network, and should not be used on public Wi-Fi or cellular networks.\nYou can use the test above to test your Wi-Fi connection. If your speed comes back slow, try getting closer to the router or connecting your device to the router with an ethernet cable. Wired connections (by ethernet cable) are generally faster than Wi-Fi connections.\nNo. Wi-Fi signal strength is different from internet speed. To learn more about your Wi-Fi signal strength and troubleshoot problems, visit our support pages.\nYou use the internet to both send and receive information. The download speed score shows how long it takes to download or receive information, while the upload test measures how long it takes to send information through the internet. Our speed test measures and reports on both.\nThe FCC’s standard for broadband internet is a download speed of at least 25 Mbps and upload speed of at least 3 Mbps. But the best way to determine how much speed you need is to think about your data needs. The average household now has 25 connected devices, from laptops and smartphones to smart TVs, headphones and gaming consoles. With so many devices, faster speeds and more bandwidth work best. Explore Verizon’s speed plans and see what internet options are available in your area.\nThere are several factors that might affect your internet speed, including how many devices you have connected, whether you’re using Wi-Fi or an ethernet cable, and even the device you’re using to connect.

The following consumer information addresses commonly asked questions about the health effects of wireless phones.\nAre Wireless Phones Safe?\nScientific research on the subject of wireless phones and radio frequency (\"RF\") energy has been conducted worldwide for many years, and continues. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") set policies and procedures for wireless phones. The FDA and the FCC have created a joint website, \"Cell Phone Facts - Consumer Information on Wireless Phones,\" which states that \"[t]he available scientific evidence does not show that any health problems are associated with using wireless phones,\" while noting that \"[t]here is no proof, however, that wireless phones are absolutely safe.\" You can access the joint FDA/FCC website at https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/radiationemittingproductsandprocedures/homebusinessandentertainment/cellphones/default.htm. You can also contact the FDA toll-free at (888) 463-6332 or (888) INFO-FDA. In June 2000, the FDA entered into a cooperative research and development agreement through which additional scientific research will be conducted. The FCC issued its own website publication stating that \"[t]here is no scientific evidence that proves that wireless phone usage can lead to cancer or a variety of other problems, including headaches, dizziness or memory loss.\" This publication is available at http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/mobilephone.html or through the FCC at (888) 225-5322 or (888) CALL-FCC.\nIn 1996, the FCC, working with the FDA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, established RF exposure safety guidelines for wireless phones in the United States. Before a wireless phone model is available for sale to the public, it must be tested by the manufacturer and certified to the FCC that it does not exceed limits established by the FCC. One of these limits is expressed as a Specific Absorption Rate, or \"SAR\". SAR is a measure of the rate of absorption of RF energy in the body. Tests for SAR are conducted with the phone transmitting at its highest power level in all tested frequency bands. Since 1996, the FCC has required that the SAR of handheld wireless phones not exceed 1.6 watts per kilogram, averaged over one gram of tissue. Although the SAR is determined at the highest power level, the actual SAR value of a wireless phone while operating can be less than the reported SAR value. This is because the SAR value may vary from call to call, depending on factors such as proximity to a cell site, the proximity of the phone to the body while in use, and the use of hands-free devices. For more information about SARs, see the FCC's OET Bulletins 56 and 65 at https://www.fcc.gov/general/oet-bulletins-line and http://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/. You may also wish to contact the manufacturer of your phone.\nCan I Minimize My RF Exposure?\nIf you are concerned about RF, there are several simple steps you can take to minimize your RF exposure. You can, of course, reduce your talk time. You can place more distance between your body and the source of the RF, as the exposure level drops off dramatically with distance. The FDA/FCC website states that \"[h]ands-free kits can be used with wireless phones for convenience and comfort. These systems reduce the absorption of RF energy in the head because the phone, which is the source of the RF emissions, will not be placed against the head. On the other hand, if the phone is mounted against the waist or other part of the body during use, then that part of the body will absorb more RF energy. Wireless phones marketed in the U.S. are required to meet safety requirements regardless of whether they are used against the head or against the body. Either configuration should result in compliance with the safety limit.\" Also, if you use your wireless phone while in a car, you can use a phone with an antenna on the outside of the vehicle. You should also read and follow your wireless phone manufacturer’s instructions for the safe operation of your phone.\nDo Wireless Phones Pose Any Special Risks to Children?\nThe FDA/FCC website states that \"[t]he scientific evidence does not show a danger to users of wireless communication devices including children.\" The FDA/FCC website further states that \"[s]ome groups sponsored by other national governments have advised that children be discouraged from using wireless phones at all. For example, the government in the United Kingdom [\"UK\"] distributed leaflets containing such a recommendation in December 2000. [The UK] noted that no evidence exists that using a wireless phone causes brain tumors or other ill effects. [The UK’s] recommendation to limit wireless phone use by children was strictly precautionary; it was not based on scientific evidence that any health hazard exists.\" A copy of the UK’s leaflet is available at http://www.dh.gov.uk (search \"mobile\"), or you can write to: NRPB, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 0RQ, United Kingdom. Copies of UK’s annual reports on mobile phones and RF are available online at http://www.iegmp.org.uk and http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/ (search \"mobile\"). Parents who wish to reduce their children’s RF exposure may choose to restrict their children’s wireless phone use.\nWhere Can I Obtain Further Information?\nFor further information, see the following additional resources:\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nFDA Consumer magazine\nNovember-December 2000\nTelephone: (888) INFO-FDA\nhttps://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/radiationemittingproductsandprocedures/medicalimaging/medicalx-rays/ucm115332.htm\nU.S. Federal Communications Commission\n445 12th St. S.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20554\nTelephone: (888) 225-5322\nhttp://www.fcc.gov/oet/rfsafety\nIndependent Expert Group on Mobile Phones\nRoyal Society of Canada\nExpert Panel on Potential Health Risks of Radiofrequency Fields from Wireless Telecommunications Devices\n283 Sparks Street\nOttawa, Ontario K1R 7X9\nCanada\nTelephone: (613) 991-6990\nhttp://www.rsc.ca/index.php?page=expert_panels_rf&lang_id=1&page_id=120\nWorld Health Organization\nAvenue Appia 20\n1211 Geneva 27\nSwitzerland\nTelephone: 011 41 22 791 21 11\nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en/\nInternational Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection\nc/o Bundesamt fur Strahlenschutz\nIngolstaedter Landstr.1\n85764 Oberschleissheim\nGermany\nTelephone: 011 49 1888 333 2156\nhttps://www.icnirp.org/\nAmerican National Standards Institute\n1819 L Street, N.W., 6th Floor\nWashington, D.C. 20036\n(202) 293-8020\nhttp://www.ansi.org\nNational Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements\n7910 Woodmont Avenue, Suite 800\nBethesda, MD 20814-3095\nTelephone: (301) 657-2652\nhttp://www.ncrponline.org",

We’ve got answers.\nCan I move my current Verizon Home Internet service to a new address?\nVerizon has made it easy for you to stay connected while you start your new adventure. For existing Fios customers, please click here to sign in to your account. For existing 5G Home Internet or LTE Home Internet customers, please click here to sign in to your account. We'll help you find out if we offer internet service at your new home and how to transfer it if we do.\nWhat internet is available at my address?\nFor Verizon Home Internet availability, it's all about the internet technology, how it's delivered to your home and where you live. Fios provides 100% fiber-optic internet with supercharged speeds and is widely available in metro and suburban areas of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. 5G Home Internet is now in more and more places around the country and is fast, reliable home internet so you can game, stream and connect the way you want.* LTE Home Internet uses the wireless 4G LTE network to deliver home broadband internet service to your residence.\nTo see which Verizon home internet service is available where you live, check availability.\n*5G Home/LTE Home Internet services provided through cellular network; speeds vary due to factors affecting cellular networks\nI'm moving and Verizon internet is available at my new address. Do I need to pay an installation fee?\nYou're in luck. For 5G Home and LTE Home service, you can set up the equipment on your own, at no cost. In some areas, 5G Home professional assistance may be available for an additional charge.\nTo transfer your Fios internet service to a new home, log in to your account to let us know that you will be moving. There may be an installation or setup charge when your new service is installed.\nWhen should I set up Verizon Home Internet at my new home?\nWe recommend placing your order for Fios internet service two weeks in advance of moving into your new home, and we're here to make the process fast and easy. If you've already moved in, you can get started right now. Verizon offers evening and weekend appointments (in most areas) for Fios. Equipment for 5G Home and LTE Home will be sent to you for self-setup. It may take 2-4 days to arrive after you place your order.\nWhat internet speed do I need when I’m moving to a new home?\nYour ideal internet speed will depend on how you are using the internet. According to a 2021 Deloitte survey, the average household has 25 devices connected to their Wi-Fi network. Each device you add will use some of your internet bandwidth, and some devices (like home security devices or smart home devices) function in the background without you thinking about them. This is why review sites like Tom's Guide recommend you get an internet speed of 200 Mbps or higher if your household has more than one person, or if you like to game or stream content.\nWhat affordable Verizon Home Internet options are available?\nVerizon participated in ACP, the Affordable Connectivity Program, while the program was active prior to the last fully funded month of April 2024. Verizon now provides reduced-cost internet to eligible new or existing home Internet customers who have qualified for Lifeline, SNAP, WIC, and other assistance programs within 180 days of application or received a Federal Pell Grant within the past year with our Verizon Forward program. Qualifying customers receive a service discount on their Fios, 5G Home or LTE Home Internet plan price. Learn more here.",
