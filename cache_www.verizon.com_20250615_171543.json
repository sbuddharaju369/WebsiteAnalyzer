Here are some examples (not your actual usage):\n| Usage habits | Recommended data amount per device |\n|---|---|\n| You mostly talk and text, but use social media occasionally | Less than 5 GB/month |\n| You stream music, upload photos on social media and browse the internet | 5 - 10 GB/month |\n| You stream video and are always online | 10+ GB/month |\nIf you already have a Verizon prepaid plan, see your usage details for actual numbers.\nYou can change your plan or add data using My Verizon.\nGood to know: Data usage for mobile hotspot devices depends on how many devices are connected to it and what they're doing. Usage could be 30 GBs or more if 3 devices are streaming music or video.\nWhat happens when I run out of high-speed data on my Prepaid hotspot & router plan?\nIf you use all your high-speed data allowance on your plan, your data speed will be reduced to 3 Mbps on 5G Ultra Wideband and 600 Kbps on 5G / 4G LTE for the rest of the month.*\n- You can't buy more high-speed data on a Prepaid hotspot & router plan.\n- You can change your plan to one that includes more data.\nThe effect on your apps depends on how much data the app uses. Video and audio streaming may be impacted. Calls and texts won't be affected.\n*Your data experience will be impacted, but you won't experience any reduction in speed while using Wi-Fi.",

We’ve got answers.\nCan I move my current Verizon Home Internet service to a new address?\nVerizon has made it easy for you to stay connected while you start your new adventure. For existing Fios customers, please click here to sign in to your account. For existing 5G Home Internet or LTE Home Internet customers, please click here to sign in to your account. We'll help you find out if we offer internet service at your new home and how to transfer it if we do.\nWhat internet is available at my address?\nFor Verizon Home Internet availability, it's all about the internet technology, how it's delivered to your home and where you live. Fios provides 100% fiber-optic internet with supercharged speeds and is widely available in metro and suburban areas of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. 5G Home Internet is now in more and more places around the country and is fast, reliable home internet so you can game, stream and connect the way you want.* LTE Home Internet uses the wireless 4G LTE network to deliver home broadband internet service to your residence.\nTo see which Verizon home internet service is available where you live, check availability.\n*5G Home/LTE Home Internet services provided through cellular network; speeds vary due to factors affecting cellular networks\nI'm moving and Verizon internet is available at my new address. Do I need to pay an installation fee?\nYou're in luck. For 5G Home and LTE Home service, you can set up the equipment on your own, at no cost. In some areas, 5G Home professional assistance may be available for an additional charge.\nTo transfer your Fios internet service to a new home, log in to your account to let us know that you will be moving. There may be an installation or setup charge when your new service is installed.\nWhen should I set up Verizon Home Internet at my new home?\nWe recommend placing your order for Fios internet service two weeks in advance of moving into your new home, and we're here to make the process fast and easy. If you've already moved in, you can get started right now. Verizon offers evening and weekend appointments (in most areas) for Fios. Equipment for 5G Home and LTE Home will be sent to you for self-setup. It may take 2-4 days to arrive after you place your order.\nWhat internet speed do I need when I’m moving to a new home?\nYour ideal internet speed will depend on how you are using the internet. According to a 2021 Deloitte survey, the average household has 25 devices connected to their Wi-Fi network. Each device you add will use some of your internet bandwidth, and some devices (like home security devices or smart home devices) function in the background without you thinking about them. This is why review sites like Tom's Guide recommend you get an internet speed of 200 Mbps or higher if your household has more than one person, or if you like to game or stream content.\nWhat affordable Verizon Home Internet options are available?\nVerizon participated in ACP, the Affordable Connectivity Program, while the program was active prior to the last fully funded month of April 2024. Verizon now provides reduced-cost internet to eligible new or existing home Internet customers who have qualified for Lifeline, SNAP, WIC, and other assistance programs within 180 days of application or received a Federal Pell Grant within the past year with our Verizon Forward program. Qualifying customers receive a service discount on their Fios, 5G Home or LTE Home Internet plan price. Learn more here.",

Biometric Identifiers do not include writing samples, written signatures, photographs, demographic data, tattoo descriptions or physical descriptions such as height or weight. “Biometric Information” means information that is based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual.\nBiometric Identifiers and Biometric DataIn Colorado, “Biometric Identifiers” means data generated by the technological processing, measurement, or analysis of biological, physical, or behavioral characteristics, which can be processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying someone, and includes fingerprints; voiceprints; scans or records of an eye retina or iris; facial maps, facial geometry, or facial templates; or other unique biological, physical or behavioral patterns or characteristics. “Biometric Data” means one or more Biometric Identifiers that are used or intended to be used, for identification purposes.\nWhat we collect and how we use it. We may collect and use certain Biometric Data or Biometric Information (“Biometric Information”) to verify or authenticate your identity; to protect against fraud; and for safety and other security purposes. We collect Biometric Information when you consent to voice or facial authentication. When you permit us to scan your face geometry or create a voiceprint, we turn it into a stored numerical representation (the “template”). Each time you scan your face geometry or later when you speak to one of our representatives, we compare your face or your voice to the stored template associated with your account. If they match, we are able to authenticate you so that you can access account information, complete account transactions, get assistance from a Verizon representative, or visit a Verizon corporate office.\nWhen we disclose Biometric Information. We may disclose Biometric Information to service providers who work on our behalf. These service providers may use the Biometric Information disclosed to them only for purposes related to providing service to Verizon, and are required to delete the information when it is no longer needed to provide the service. We may also disclose Biometric Information to comply with law as described in the Does Verizon Disclose Information section of this Policy.\nHow long we retain Biometric Information and information security. We retain Biometric Information as follows (unless we are legally required to retain it longer):\n- We retain scans of your face geometry or voiceprint very briefly. We permanently delete the first scan after we use it to generate the stored template. Each time you authenticate, we retain your face geometry or voiceprint scan long enough to compare it to the template, then we permanently delete the scan.\n- We retain the stored template until the purpose for collecting it is satisfied. For instance, we retain stored templates of face scans for approximately 90 days from the date that you provided it. We retain voiceprints for as long as you are an active customer and are enrolled in voice authentication. Voiceprints are deleted approximately 24 hours after unenrollment or termination of service.\n- We may also retain biometric data as otherwise required to comply with applicable law or valid legal/judicial process.\n- We use technical, administrative and physical safeguards as set forth in this Privacy Policy to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of information we collect or store. We use our security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving data we process.\nWhere to exercise your rights.
