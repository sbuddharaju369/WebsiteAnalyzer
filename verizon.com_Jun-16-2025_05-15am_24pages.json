Only pay for what you need.\nSavings & discounts only with Verizon\nHave questions? We’ve got answers.\nCan I keep my current Verizon wireless plan?\nYes, users with an existing plan can keep their current plan. However, if you're on an existing Mix & Match or Welcome Unlimited plan you can choose to switch one or all of your lines to myPlan at any time. All other plans must switch all of their lines if moving to myPlan.\nWhat are the differences between Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome?\nAll of Verizon's Unlimited plans include unlimited talk, text, and data, as well as 5G (or 4G LTE in areas where 5G isn't available), Mexico and Canada talk, text and data, as well as International texting. Unlimited plans have access to Verizon's 3-year price lock guarantee along with a phone upgrade.\nUnlimited Welcome gives you Verizon's reliable, fast 5G and the Welcome Phone Upgrade for new and existing customers.\nWith Unlimited Plus, you get our fastest 5G and access to 30 GB of Premium unlimited mobile hotspot data per month, then unlimited thereafter at 3 Mbps on 5G Ultra Wideband and 600 Kbps on 5G/4G LTE to power your other devices on the go.\nVerizon's Unlimited Ultimate offers 200 GB of premium data (unlimited thereafter at 6 Mbps) and unlimited calling and texting from 200+ countries. In addition to unlimited calling, you get enhanced video calling which has optimized video and sound quality on video calling apps in times of network congestion, when it matters most. With Unlimited Ultimate you also get 15 GB international roaming data a month, then unlimited thereafter at 1.5 mbps, and the ability to turn on 1080p HD with streaming quality of up to 4K Ultra High Definition when you’re using 5G Ultra Wideband network on a capable device.\nCheck out our latest promotions and offers.\nCan I mix and match between Unlimited Ultimate, Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Welcome?\nActivating more than one line? If you'd like to choose Unlimited Ultimate or Unlimited Plus for some lines but Unlimited Welcome for others, you can do that. Just choose the plan you'd like for each specific line, for up to 12 lines, when you sign up for myPlan. Learn more.\nWhat are the benefits of adding a perk through Verizon?\nSave every month - check out the price savings on your favorite monthly subscriptions. Additionally, by adding perks to your plan through Verizon, you can manage those perks and subscriptions all in one place. For example, if you sign up for one of the available perk memberships, you can manage the membership through your Verizon bill and keep track of those charges all in one place.\nWill new perks be added?\nYes– keep checking back for new, updated perks. Since you aren't locked in with myPlan to any specific contract, you can add new perks or change them at any time. Just one of the many benefits of our new Unlimited plans!\nWhat is data on a cell phone plan?\nWhen you aren't connected to Wi-Fi, you connect to the internet using data. So, if you're logging onto the web but not connected to Wi-Fi, your phone will require a data plan. This includes while using apps that require an internet connection, such as social media apps and certain mobile games, etc.\nWhat is an unlimited data plan?\nSome cell phone plans limit the amount of data you can use per month (measured in gigabytes, or \"GB\"), while an unlimited data plan doesn't limit you. It's an unlimited number of GBs. Depending on which plan you select, your speeds may be slower in times of congestion. Review your plan for details.\nWhat happens if I already have a subscription to a perk?\nIt depends on the perk and the current subscription you have. You may need to manage your existing subscription to activate a perk. Please see the specific perk FAQs on what happens with existing subscriptions: Disney Bundle, Netflix® & Max (With Ads), Apple One, Apple Music, Walmart+, 2 TB Cloud Storage, Smartwatch Data & Safety and Three TravelPass Days perk FAQs.\nHow do I bring my phone number to Verizon from another carrier?\nWhen you activate a new line with Verizon you'll have the option to transfer your current mobile or landline number from another carrier.\nYou can also visit our Switch to Verizon page online, contact us or visit a store to transfer your number to Verizon.\n- Unlimited Ultimate: Unlimited mobile hotspot data: After 200 GB of Premium Data, Unlimited thereafter at 6 Mbps.

It uses fiber optics to transmit data at the speed of light, providing a fast internet connection and powerful bandwidth for multiple devices. Verizon is one of the only internet service providers to offer matching download and upload speeds on most of our plans, which is a major advantage when you’re video chatting, gaming and sharing large files or images.\nWhat is LTE Home Internet?\nLTE Home Internet is home broadband internet service that brings the Verizon 4G LTE network to your residence.

If you're eligible to get a bill credit for up to $500 for an early termination fee charged by your previous home internet provider, here's how to get it. If you order Fios home internet, see the Fios Early Termination Fee instructions.

We've got answers.\nHow do I know if I can bring my number?\nMost phone numbers are eligible to be brought to Verizon*, but some numbers may not be eligible based on geography, service area coverage, technology, or ownership of the line you're transferring from. You can always check your eligibility before you switch to Verizon.\n*Local Number Portability, a government mandate, requires mobile and landline service providers to let customers keep their eligible phone numbers when switching carriers.\nHow do I unlock my phone?\nTo unlock your AT&T phone, there are some requirements you should be aware of. Your device must be:\n- Paid off.\n- Not associated with another active AT&T account.\n- Not reported as lost, stolen, or involved with fraud.\nYou also have to be sure to not have a past-due account balance with AT&T in order to fully unlock your device.\nOnce you meet these requirements, you can submit a \"Device Unlock\" request via AT&T's website, or one of our retail representatives can assist you if you're visiting us in-store.\nFor a phone locked to T-Mobile's network, first make sure your phone is eligible for unlocking, then follow these steps:\n- Make sure you are connected to your wireless network or Wi-Fi.\n- For Android phones, you can typically find a \"device unlock\" or \"network unlock\" option in Settings.\n- For Apple phones, simply contact T-Mobile and request that they unlock the device.\nFor other carriers and brands, you should call your mobile provider for guidance.\nWhat is my device ID and how do I find it?\nA device ID is a string of letters and numbers used to uniquely identify your smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch. Your device ID is stored on your device and can be retrieved by any app that is downloaded and installed. There are a few ways to find your device ID, with the easiest one being in your device's Settings menu.\nFor Apple devices, go to Settings > General > About. Scroll to find your IMEI number.\nFor other devices, like Android, go to Settings > System > About Phone. Look for your IMEI number listed here or tap Status for more info.\nFor additional ways to find your device ID, play this video.\n2. Family Monitoring: Verizon Family included in monthly plan price and includes location monitoring, 1 location alert, driving insights (self), and Safe Walk w/SOS. T-Mobile’s FamilyMode® and AT&T’s Secure Family® offer similar features as Verizon Family location monitoring and Safe Walk w/SOS, but also include multiple location alerts and parental controls, such as screen time limits.\n3. 60 min international calling: Comparison based on mobile-to-mobile international calling rates from the U.S. to locations outside of the U.S. for Verizon’s Global Choice plan (included with Unlimited Ultimate plan), AT&T’s International Calling package (optional $15/line for international calling to 85+ countries and discounted rates to other countries), and T-Mobile’s Stateside International Talk package (optional $15/line or $20/account with unlimited international mobile-to-mobile calling to 30+ countries and discounted rates to other countries). Verizon Unlimited Ultimate plan allows customers to choose one country to call at no additional cost for up to 300 minutes, with the number of included minutes depending on the location chosen. Calls to the chosen location that exceed the monthly allotment, and calls to other countries, are charged a discounted per minute rate. Additional details on international calling.",

Biometric Identifiers do not include writing samples, written signatures, photographs, demographic data, tattoo descriptions or physical descriptions such as height or weight. “Biometric Information” means information that is based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual.\nBiometric Identifiers and Biometric DataIn Colorado, “Biometric Identifiers” means data generated by the technological processing, measurement, or analysis of biological, physical, or behavioral characteristics, which can be processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying someone, and includes fingerprints; voiceprints; scans or records of an eye retina or iris; facial maps, facial geometry, or facial templates; or other unique biological, physical or behavioral patterns or characteristics. “Biometric Data” means one or more Biometric Identifiers that are used or intended to be used, for identification purposes.\nWhat we collect and how we use it. We may collect and use certain Biometric Data or Biometric Information (“Biometric Information”) to verify or authenticate your identity; to protect against fraud; and for safety and other security purposes. We collect Biometric Information when you consent to voice or facial authentication. When you permit us to scan your face geometry or create a voiceprint, we turn it into a stored numerical representation (the “template”). Each time you scan your face geometry or later when you speak to one of our representatives, we compare your face or your voice to the stored template associated with your account. If they match, we are able to authenticate you so that you can access account information, complete account transactions, get assistance from a Verizon representative, or visit a Verizon corporate office.\nWhen we disclose Biometric Information. We may disclose Biometric Information to service providers who work on our behalf. These service providers may use the Biometric Information disclosed to them only for purposes related to providing service to Verizon, and are required to delete the information when it is no longer needed to provide the service. We may also disclose Biometric Information to comply with law as described in the Does Verizon Disclose Information section of this Policy.\nHow long we retain Biometric Information and information security. We retain Biometric Information as follows (unless we are legally required to retain it longer):\n- We retain scans of your face geometry or voiceprint very briefly. We permanently delete the first scan after we use it to generate the stored template. Each time you authenticate, we retain your face geometry or voiceprint scan long enough to compare it to the template, then we permanently delete the scan.\n- We retain the stored template until the purpose for collecting it is satisfied. For instance, we retain stored templates of face scans for approximately 90 days from the date that you provided it. We retain voiceprints for as long as you are an active customer and are enrolled in voice authentication. Voiceprints are deleted approximately 24 hours after unenrollment or termination of service.\n- We may also retain biometric data as otherwise required to comply with applicable law or valid legal/judicial process.\n- We use technical, administrative and physical safeguards as set forth in this Privacy Policy to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of information we collect or store. We use our security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving data we process.\nWhere to exercise your rights. Colorado residents may submit a request to know or access biometric data by:\n- visiting our Privacy Dashboard or\n- calling 1-800-333-3972.\nMaine Broadband Customer Privacy Rights\nThe Maine Broadband Internet Access Service Customer Privacy Act, effective on July 1, 2020, gives you additional privacy rights when we are your broadband Internet access service provider.
